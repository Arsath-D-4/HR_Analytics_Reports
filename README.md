# HR_Analytics_Reports

## Overview

This project focuses on building a Data Analytics Dashboard using Power BI to automate HR processes at AtliQ Technologies. The dashboard provides valuable insights into employee working preferences, wellness, and overall presence.

## Requirements

The HR department required the following insights:
- **Working preferences** of employees between Work From Home (WFH) and Work From Office (WFO).
- **Percentage of overall sick leave** to monitor employee wellness.
- **Reasons** behind frequent WFH choices.
- **Learning Power BI basics** through the development of this project.

## Benefits

With the insights generated from this dashboard, HR can:
- Improve capacity planning for a hybrid work model (e.g., WFH 2 days, WFO 3 days).
- Optimize space utilization, saving costs on infrastructure.

## Dashboard Features

The dashboard provides Presence Insights for employees, including:

1. **Presence, Work From Home, and Sick Leave tracking** for AtliQ Technologies.
2. Analysis on various parameters to meet HR requirements.
